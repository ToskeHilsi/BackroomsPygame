### PLANNED FEATURES

- Multiple Levels
- Sprinting by holding Space
- Start on level 0, progress through others
- Add an entity that spawns scarecely in level 0, not at all in level 37, and ___ (fill as you go)
  The entity does not try to kill the player, but it freaks them out by making them question whether they saw it or not.
